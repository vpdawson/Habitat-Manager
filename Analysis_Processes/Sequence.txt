If you use the graphical modeler 

Generate basemap layer (HCMGIS) plugin 

Create points from DBF
Identify Cluster center Vector--> Analysis Tools--> Mean coordinates  (unique ID cluster)
	The minimum cluster area size is 4.05 ha (10 ac),
	The minimum number of cavity trees in a cluster is one.  
	Cavity trees assigned to a cluster may be just a few feet apart or over a hundred feet apart.  
	
create 200ft buffer (tree)
	The minimum buffer distance around the cluster is 200 feet, but may be wider where a 200-foot buffer encompasses less than 10 acres

create vorronni polygons (tree) / 
Clip Vorronni with 200m buffer
	Concave (Nearest neighbor) - vorronni buffer
	Convex - concave
	statistics - Covert meters-sq to ac/ha/ft/mile
